The Team Management Profile (TMP) is a globally trusted development tool used by over 2.5 million professionals worldwide to boost individual and team effectiveness. Backed by over 40 years of research by Drs.

Frequently Asked Questions
Does TMP measure personality?
Not exactly. TMP focuses on work-based preferences—how people prefer to behave at work—not on fixed personality traits.
Does your job influence your preferences?
Yes. Over time, role demands and culture can shape how preferences are expressed, especially when initial preferences are less clear.
Do preferences differ in work and non-work situations?
Yes. TMP research shows people often adapt their preferences based on context. For example, someone might be Structured at work but Flexible outside it. The TMP focuses specifically on work-based behavior.
Can the TMP be used for recruitment?
No. The TMP is not designed to predict job success and shouldn’t be used for recruitment or selection decisions. However, it can support job analysis and interview question design. It's best used post-hire to support onboarding and team integration.
Can TMP help with career coaching?
Yes. It supports career guidance by showing which roles or environments align with a person’s natural strengths.
What is the validity of the TMP?
The TMP has strong validity across three areas: face validity (91%+ agreement in global studies), structural validity (clear links between preferences and work types), and construct validity (validated against tools like MBTI, Belbin, and 16pf). It’s endorsed by the British Psychological Society as a reliable workplace tool.
