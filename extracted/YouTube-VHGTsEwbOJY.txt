Title: What is Stakeholder Engagement?
0:08
stakeholder engagement it's one of the
0:10
business world's most popular buzzwords
0:13
but what does it really
0:15
mean no it's not that huh it's not that
0:20
either clever but no huh uhhuh let's
0:23
back up a bit say your company makes
0:26
widgets and business is booming
0:28
naturally people start to notice you one
0:31
day you drive to work to find protesters
0:34
at the company Gates claiming your
0:35
widgets use a toxin that is bad for the
0:39
planet soon more stakeholders hear about
0:42
the protests and decide to join the
0:44
campaign suddenly you're in the news for
0:47
all the wrong reasons yikes so what do
0:49
you do you're the bad guy so maybe you
0:52
call the authorities arrest the
0:55
activists and tell your story explaining
0:58
the many great things your company does
1:00
and how ridiculous those crazy hippies
1:02
are problem solved right um not so fast
1:07
in the end it doesn't matter who's right
1:10
and who's wrong the cycle of
1:12
demonization and finger pointing rarely
1:14
leads to Solutions and almost always to
1:16
gridlock and a tarnished
1:18
brand to overcome this cycle we at
1:22
Future 500 advocate for stakeholder
1:24
engagement technically it's the
1:26
systematic and proactive integration of
1:29
feedback from from those impacted by
1:31
your organization's operations in
1:33
practice it's all about
1:36
humanization when we acknowledge our
1:38
shared humanity and admit that none of
1:40
us is perfect we can begin removing our
1:42
masks and working together to find
1:44
Common Ground stakeholder engagement
1:47
means building trust even between those
1:49
with very different views from right to
1:52
left corporate to
1:54
NGO it means knocking on doors before
1:56
problems arise rather than after
2:00
it means listening more than talking it
2:03
means communicating with humility rather
2:05
than boasting and it means engaging over
2:08
and over again to continue raising the
2:10
bar in a way that's better for your
2:12
stakeholders your planet and your bottom
2:15
line now it doesn't always have to be
2:17
formal after all most friendships aren't
2:20
built in the boardroom and having a
2:22
little fun never hurt
2:24
either when we stop building walls and
2:27
start building
2:28
bridges we cre create a space for
2:30
solutions that are systemic Innovative
2:33
and
2:34
Lasting so the next time you find
2:36
protesters at your gate consider this
2:39
maybe you shouldn't have a gate in the
2:41
first
2:43
place future 500 is a San Francisco
2:46
based nonprofit specializing in
2:48
stakeholder engagement we align the
2:50
power of the private sector with the
2:52
purpose of its most critical
2:53
