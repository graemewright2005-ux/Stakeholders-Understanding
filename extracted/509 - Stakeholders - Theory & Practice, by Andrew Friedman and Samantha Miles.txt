‘PREFACE
The stakeholder field of theory, practice, and policy has reached a crossroads. Leading
up to where we are now, there has been enormous growth in the popularity of theconcept among academics and policymakers and this has encouraged managers, stake-holders, and their representatives to develop practices informed by the stakeholderconcept. One clear path ahead is that the development of theory, practice, and policycontinue to reinforce each other, leading to greater and wider influence of the concepton practice and policy. However, as the concept has become more popular, the path hasbecome tangled with the many different ways the concept has been used. For example,different practices have come to be called stakeholder activities, particularly by thoseseeking to use the label to legitimize their actions. Also, a range of different definitions as
to what a stakeholder is has emerged. Concentrating on these issues encourages a view of
a second future path of the stakeholder field: as a fad that is rapidly passing its time ofinfluence, which peters out as a future marker for progress. Already we notice areluctance to use the word stakeholder among managers because of their concern thatits meaning is unclear.
Aims and Approach
The primary aim of Stakeholders: Theory and Practice is to encourage the field along the
first path. This book analyses, classifies, and critiques the diffused strands of thestakeholder literature. The authors believe that such a ‘sorting’ is necessary because ofthe widely recognized ‘muddle’ that has accompanied the popularity of the stakeholderconcept. Major theoretical contributions are placed in the context of their philosophicalunderpinnings and are discussed along with literature aimed at recommending, de-scribing, and analysing practical strategies and specific policies. Though the stakeholderconcept is fairly new it has developed substantially, particularly since Freeman’s land-mark book of 1984. One important aspect of this development has been a decentring ofthe concept away from exclusive focus on corporate strategy and/or corporate morality.Although the overwhelming majority of the stakeholder literature is concerned withpublicly owned corporations, some have sought to open space for other kinds oforganizations to be considered (Smillie and Helmich 1999). More radically, ratherthan being limited to stakeholder management, representing how organizations ought
to behave (for their own strategic good or for a wider social good), the concept has been
widened by some to embrace stakeholders’ own perspectives as complementing, andsometimes opposing, the organization perspective (Calton and Lad 1995; Frooman1999). In this book we allow for a broad perspective by considering theories in relationtheorganization–stakeholder relationship . The design of this book supports this perspec-
tive. It reflects distinctions, which we believe have been key to the historical develop-ment of the stakeholder concept, and will be important for the future influence of theconcept, and the agenda of those who see the concept as encouraging a change in howorganizations and stakeholders interact. These distinctions are:
1. Among theory, practice, and policy. These are the subjects of distinct literatures that
often show a surprising lack of appreciation of each other. A major purpose of thisbook is to bring these literatures together while emphasizing common themes. Foreach of these subjects a framework or model is presented to allow different contri-butions to be compared (Sections 3.2.4, 6.5, and 9.2).
2. Between normative and analytical approaches. This distinction is commonly ex-
pressed as a three-way classification: normative, instrumental, and descriptive. Theterm normative is generally used in the stakeholder literature in what would bethought of as the philosophic sense: as a prescriptive and categorical provision ofguidance for actions and policies in all circumstances because it is the ‘right’ thing todo. Elsewhere in management literature it is used in a hypothetical sense in the formof ‘If you want to achieve X, then do Y’ . Donaldson and Preston (1995) refer to this as‘instrumental’ . Here we use the term analytic to cover both instrumental theory anddescriptive theory (Section 2.6).
3. Between organization-centred and stakeholder perspectives. This is one aspect of a
general sensitivity to the social construction of the concept, i.e., sensitivity todiffering perspectives on the concept by different people, affected by their socialposition. The stakeholder relation is dynamic and potentially highly contested andthis can be reflected in the very concept of stakeholders being contested as well(Chapter 5).
Limitations
We concentrate on organization–stakeholder relations more than on macropoliticalissues of governance and the broader use of the concept of stakeholders such as theidea of stakeholder pensions. Both are important, but this book is mainly aimed atreaders interested in stakeholder management within organizations and the ways thatstakeholders influence organizations. Macro issues are approached in terms of theirviii PREFACE
relevance for these more micro-level (or meso-level) theories and practice. We also do
not concentrate on detailed review of evidence for specific hypotheses in the literature,although we do briefly review the evidence for the fundamental instrumental stake-holder proposition in Chapter 5.
How to use Stakeholders: Theory and Practice
This book is distinctive in that it deals with theory, practice, policy, and education.
There are four types of books that specialize in the stakeholder field:
1. Theoretical monographs that comprehensively deal with a single theory or a narrow
collection of theories. Other theories are dealt with primarily as background leadingup to the theory being proposed, or are only summarized in order to point outtheir failings and how the proposed theory is an improvement (Clarkson 1994;Post, Preston, and Sachs 2002; Phillips 2003 b). These books may present recom-
mendations for practice and policy but do not attempt a comprehensive reviewof either.
2. Practical guides and presentation of examples of good and bad practice. These are
intended more for managers in practice (Svendsen 1998; Andriof et al. 2002, 2003),rather than managers in education where more reflective approaches are called for.
3. Collections of articles focused around a specific theme within the stakeholder field
(Clarkson 1998; Sharma and Starik 2004) or a collection of papers given at a themedconference (Na ¨si 1995; Kelly, Kelly, and Gamble 1997). These are limited to the aspect
of the stakeholder field that the editors or conference organizers believed to be new orimportant.
4. Applications of the stakeholder concept to specific fields: financial reporting (Stittle
2003), corporate governance (Alkhafaji 1989), business ethics (Weiss 1998, 2003),and marketing (Duncan and Moriarty 1997).
Beyond these relatively few types of books, the vast majority of stakeholder literature is
to be found in articles in a wide range of academic journals, as can be seen in theReferences to this book. Stakeholders: Theory and Practice is unlike all the above types of
books in that it presents many theories, each in its own terms and not as part of buildingup to a single theory or as foils to the preferred theory. It is not primarily aimed atmanagement practitioners and is intended to guide students of management andmanagement strategy, as well as students studying business ethics, organization behav-iour, and related fields such as corporate governance, environmental management,sociology, and politics.PREFACE ix
Stakeholders: Theory and Practice deals with the stakeholder field in a comprehensive
manner. In this the only comparable book is Freeman (1984). Freeman surveyed use ofthe stakeholder concept up to the writing of his book. He expressed the concept clearly,emphasized the way the concept could be implemented by management in practice,discussed consequences of taking the concept seriously for business success and indeedsurvival, and issued warnings of the consequences of ignoring stakeholders for corpor-ate survival. What emerged from Freeman (1984) was a clear statement of the stake-holder concept, but what we would regard as a narrow statement in that it was writtenfrom the perspective of management and, more narrowly, of management strategy. Itwas also strongly slanted towards a descriptive and instrumental approach, rather than anormative approach (which Freeman himself took up with vigour subsequent to his1984 book).
We regard Stakeholders: Theory and Practice as ‘updating’ Freeman (1984) in that we
provide a summary of the development of the stakeholder concept up to 2005. Thisinvolves much more attention being devoted to developments of the concept, particu-larly since 1984, and to an assessment of the extent to which the concept has been putinto practice and has influenced policymaking and management education. The latter
issues were not addressed by Freeman (1984) largely because they postdate his book.
What emerges from Stakeholders: Theory and Practice is a complex statement of a
multifarious stakeholder concept, replete with different philosophical underpinnings,many definitions of the term stakeholder, diverse implications for management practice,as well as implications for stakeholder strategies and actions and for policymakers. Thecontribution of Stakeholders: Theory and Practice is not, as for Freeman (1984), to
provide a clear statement of the concept with clear implications for managementstrategy, but rather to provide a clear statement of this fundamental variety, via variousmethods and models, which allow the field to be ordered and more easily understood,and allow more considered judgements to be made on the diverse components ofthe field.
An underlying reason for Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach was the
turbulence Freeman detected in the situation of US business in the early 1980s:accelerated mergers and acquisitions; recognition of new and powerful competitorsfrom abroad, particularly Japan; and increased pressures at home on US corporationsfrom employees, environmentalists, the media, consumer groups, and other specialinterest groups. The stakeholder concept was presented as an important potentialremedy for these ills. An underlying reason for Stakeholders: Theory and Practice is
turbulence in the stakeholder field, due to the variety of competing and complementaryformulations and of derived implications from different contributors (due to thepopularity of the stakeholder concept). This popularity has been driven not only byfurther development of many of the issues ‘on the ground’ that Freeman was respondingto (continued globalization and sensitization of stakeholders, and particularly thexPREFACE
media, to organization–stakeholder relations), but also by new issues in practice, arising
from the manner in which organizations have responded to the call for stakeholdermanagement. In consequence, the stakeholder concept is presented here as a relativelymature field of thought, practice, and policy where clarity in ordering the field is whatwe believe is required and what we have attempted to provide.
The plethora of stakeholder theories and practices are classified along specific di-
mensions using models in the form of figures. Concepts underlying the many stake-holder theories, as well as brief examples of stakeholder practice, are clearly set out in theform of vignettes. We have emphasized exposition at the expense of critique of existingstakeholder theory and practice. However, occasionally we have provided a criticalperspective, such as on the convergence debate (Section 5.3). Finally, at the end ofeach chapter we have provided a set of questions/exercises. By and large, these are broadand rather difficult questions to answer. We offer them as possible essay and dissertationtopics for students as well as pointers towards future directions of stakeholder research.PREFACE xi

1Introduction
1.1The stakeholder concept
The classic de Wnition of a stakeholder is ‘any group or individual who can a Vect or is
aVected by the achievement of the organization’s objectives’ (Freeman 1984: 46). 1At its
broadest and most ambitious the stakeholder concept represents a rede Wnition of all
organizations: how they should be conceptualized and what they should be. Theorganization itself should be thought of as a grouping of stakeholders and the purposeof the organization should be to manage their interests, needs and viewpoints. In sodoing, a particular group of stakeholders—(top-level) managers—are thought of as thefocal group, charged with ful Wlling the role of stakeholder management. The concept
was elaborated by Evan and Freeman (1993: 82) as the following two principles:
1.Principle of corporate legitimacy . The corporation should be managed for the bene Wt
of its stakeholders: its customers, suppliers, owners, employees, and local commu-nities. The rights of these groups must be ensured, and, further, the groups mustparticipate, in some sense, in decisions that substantially a Vect their welfare.
2.The stakeholder Wduciary principle . Management bears a Wduciary relationship
(Vignette 1.1) to stakeholders and to the corporation as an abstract entity. It mustact in the interests of the stakeholders as their agent, and it must act in the interests ofthe corporation to ensure the survival of the Wrm, safeguarding the long-term stakes
of each group.
Vignette 1.1 WHAT ARE FIDUCIARY DUTIES?
Fiduciary duties are duties of one who holds something in trust, according to the Oxford English Dictionary . The
duties required are honesty, adequate care for that which is entrusted, and transparency and trust that the
fiduciary will avoid personal gain or harm to the beneficiary (Marens and Wicks 1999). This is most commonly
associated with the relationship between management and shareholders. Unlike other agents who provide the
corporation with various types of capital, contracts or other forms of safeguards do not protect shareholders
(due to their claim being residual and not relating to specific assets) rendering their investment open to greater
risk. Consequently, fiduciary duties are imposed on managers to protect the shareholders as legal owners who
are not in a position to manage their own affairs. Legally, the relationship is not with the shareholder but with
the shareholder’s investment.
The de Wnition of a stakeholder, the characterization of the organization and its
purpose, characterizations of the role that managers do take on or should take onare all contested, even within the ‘camp’ of those who would consider themselves tobe proponents of the stakeholder concept. Freeman uses a di Verent de Wnition of
stakeholders as ‘those groups who are vital to the survival and success of the corpor-ation’ (2004: 58) in later work in which the two principles are altered and renamed(2004: 64):
1.The stakeholder-enabling principle . Corporations shall be managed in the interests of
stakeholders.
2.The principle of director responsibility . Directors of the corporation shall have a duty
of care to use reasonable judgement to de Wne and direct the a Vairs of the corporation
in accordance with the stakeholder-enabling principle.
He adds a further principle, which re Xects a relatively new tendency in stakeholder
theory, i.e. to consider the stakeholder concept from the perspective of the stakeholdersthemselves and their activities (2004: 64):
The principle of stakeholder recourse . Stakeholders may bring an action against the directors for
failure to perform the required duty of care.
These elaborations of the stakeholder concept are versions of normative stakeholder
theory, meaning theories of how managers (and sometimes stakeholders) shouldact and should view the purpose of the organization, based on some ethical principle.There are other approaches to the stakeholder concept. Some are concerned withhow managers and stakeholders actually behave and how they view their actionsand roles. These have been labelled as descriptive stakeholder theory. Some are con-
cerned with how managers should act if they are to further their own interests orwhat theorists conceive as the interests of the organization, usually viewed as (long-run) pro Wt maximization or maximization of stockholder value. This strategic
approach is generally based on what has been called instrumental stakeholder theory,
which is the proposition that if managers treat stakeholders in line with the stake-holder concept, then the organization will be more successful or more likely to besustainable. This three-way categorization of approaches to the stakeholder conceptwas popularized by Donaldson and Preston (1995). Relations among these ways ofelaborating the stakeholder concept have been subject to considerable debate in theacademic literature. This is discussed in Chapters 2 and 5. A discussion of the rangeof stakeholder de Wnitions and the range of groups included in the de Wnition follows
in Section 1.3.2INTRODUCTION
1.2Context of the stakeholder concept
and its popularity
Interest in the concept of stakeholders among academics has burgeoned in recent years.
Donaldson and Preston (1995: 65) noted that a dozen books and more than 100 articlesprimarily concerned with the stakeholder concept had appeared. Since then interest inthe stakeholder concept has quickened even further. Simply type out the word stake-holders in a search engine such as Google Scholar and you will Wnd more than 100,000
references. 2Several issues of notable journals have been devoted to elaborating and
debating the stakeholder concept ( Business Ethics Quarterly , 1994: 4/4; 2002: 12/2;
Critical Perspectives in Accounting , 1998: 9/2; Academy of Management Review , 1999:
24/2; Academy of Management Journal , 1999: 42/5). The stakeholder concept has also
grown in popularity among policymakers, regulators, non-governmental organizations(NGOs), business, and the media (Section 2.5).
Many contributors to the stakeholder concept have made their contributions (par-
ticularly normative contributions) in debate with those who promote the chief rivalvision of the corporation and the role of its top managers: the stockholder (shareholder) 3
model, based on ownership. The objective of the corporation is to maximize stockholdervalue expressed either as maximizing long-run pro Wts, growth, or dividends (though
how long this long run should be is debatable). Friedman (1962: 74) argued that this isthe ‘one and only social responsibility of business’ as long as companies keep to the rulesof the capitalist game, i.e. ‘engage in open and free competition without deception orfraud’ . However, this view appears to be giving way to the view that business has wider
responsibilities and that those responsibilities are best expressed in terms of the stake-
holder concept. A further measure of the popularity of the stakeholder concept has beenthe recent proliferation of literature broadly contesting the concept and reiterating theview that stakeholder concept promoters have been speci Wcally trying to replace (Argenti
1993, 1997; Sternberg 1997, 2000; Marcoux 2000, 2003) (Section 5.2).
1.3Stakeholder definitions: profusion and some
confusion
Partly in consequence of its popularity, the stakeholder concept has come to be used in a
variety of contexts, often with somewhat di Verent de Wnitions of stakeholders. This has
led to the concept being criticized as:INTRODUCTION 3
.A ‘muddling of theoretical bases and objectives’ (Donaldson and Preston 1995: 73).
.‘A rather vague and cryptic concept that is open to a wide variety of rather divergent
political interpretations’ (referring to a vision of a stakeholder society, Hay 1996: 47).
.A ‘slippery creature . . . used by di Verent people to mean widely di Verent things which
happen to suit their arguments’ (Weyer 1996: 35).
.The term stakeholding becoming ‘content free’ meaning ‘almost anything the author
desires’ and the stakeholder debate becoming ‘confused’ and ‘often shallow’ in nature(Stoney and Winstanley 2001: 650).
DiVerent literatures adopting di Verent de Wnitions have hampered cross-discipline re-
search and debate. This may be thought of as an example of negative consequences ofthe elaboration of discourse. Groups of writers come to coalesce around particularsocial constructions of reality, leading to writers referring to stakeholders without beingaware of relevant theoretical issues that have been raised in other literatures. Forexample, Roberts and Mahoney (2004: 400) criticized accounting researchers who either‘fail to incorporate stakeholder research published in business ethics literature’ or ‘relyon diVerent versions of stakeholder theory’ . They examined 125 accounting studies that
use stakeholder language and found that nearly two-thirds ‘use the term stakeholder
without reference to any version of stakeholder theory’ . Writers use the same label torefer to substantially di Verent concepts, for example some use the term ‘stakeholders’ ,
but are clearly referring only to legitimate stakeholders, without de Wning legitimacy
(Section 5.4.3). Others use a much broader de Wnition. This distinction can have
substantial consequences on ethical, strategic, and policy conclusions.
1.3.1 WHAT IS A STAKEHOLDER?
Table 1.1 presents a summary of Wfty-Wve de Wnitions covering seventy- Wve texts ar-
ranged in chronological order. 4The earliest de Wnition is often credited to an internal
memo produced in 1963 by the Stanford Research Institute: ‘those groups withoutwhose support the organization would cease to exist’ 5(Freeman, 1984: 31). Similar
deWnitions have been advocated by Bowie (1988), Freeman and Reed (1983), and Na ¨si
(1995). Freeman (2004: 58) has continued to use this de Wnition in a modi Wed form:
‘those groups who are vital to the survival and success of the organization’ . Clearly, thisdeWnition is entirely organization-centric. It is also a stringent de Wnition; it excludes
categories of agents that other de Wnitions include.
In what is commonly regarded, at least in academic circles, as seminal stakeholder
text, stakeholders are de Wned as ‘any group or individual who can a Vect or is a Vected by
the achievement of the organization objectives’ (Freeman 1984: 46). Table 1.1 gives anindication of the popularity of this de Wnition. This de Wnition is more balanced and4INTRODUCTION
