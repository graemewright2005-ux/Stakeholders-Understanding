Exercise 2 - Communicating with Different Stakeholders

Read the scenario below, then use the template to provide advice to Fabian on the most appropriate way to engage with the stakeholders. Provide justification for the methods you have selected.  

Scenario:
Fabian, the manager of the Customer Experience team at Funstar, a company which specialises in family package holidays, has recently seen a dip in performance by his team members, and a resulting increase in customer complaints. Recent customer feedback indicates that the team has not projected the welcoming attitude the company expects, and that some team members are just ‘going through the motions’ in their interactions with customers. The number of subscribers to Funstar’s newsletter has also gone down. Fabian wants to explore the underlying root causes of this problem. He also needs to swiftly respond to the disappointed customers, and implement a plan to keep them from deserting Funstar for the competition. 

How would you suggest Fabian approaches these two challenges?
Your advice should be approximately 200 to 250 words.
