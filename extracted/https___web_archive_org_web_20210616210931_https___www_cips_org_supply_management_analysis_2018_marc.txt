McDonald’s   UK spends £1bn every year through its supply chain, and  Connor McVeigh   decides where the money goes. He talks Brexit, British  potatoes and making   big bets
Twenty-six   grams of iceberg lettuce might not sound like much, but  it contains an   important lesson about supply chain at McDonald’s.  Early in 2017, a greens   shortage hit the UK, thanks to a dearth of  salad in the Mediterranean region.   Some British supermarkets even  started rationing iceberg lettuces.
This humble   lettuce is critical for the construction of one of the  most iconic – and best   selling – products at McDonald’s: the Big Mac.  As UK supply chain director   Connor McVeigh explains to SM when we meet  at the company’s UK head office   (in its restaurant, of course), a Big  Mac can only be served with the   requisite 26g of lettuce between its  buns. The salad deficit could have been   severely disruptive. But  McDonald’s, unlike many other retailers and   restaurant chains, didn’t  suffer a shortage.
The reason? “We   had been working with that [iceberg lettuce]  supplier for the last 26 years.   They knew they had a long-term,  growing business with us in the future, and   that’s why they  prioritised us,” says McVeigh.
A focus on   the long term is what characterises the McDonald’s  supply chain strategy,   according to McVeigh. He joined the fast-food  restaurant chain in November   2013, having spent most of his career  buying food for major supermarkets   (Morrisons and Sainsbury’s). At  McDonald’s his remit is wide, covering purchasing,   agriculture,  restaurant sustainability, distribution and logistics, quality   and  nutrition.
“Twenty   years ago, my role was buying fresh produce,” he recalls.  “Negotiations were   done week to week, sometimes day to day. The  supplier base would be different   from year to year.” By way of  comparison, in the four years he has been at   McDonald’s, his supplier  base hasn’t changed. “There’s a greater focus on   partnership – open  communication and engagement and long-term relations,” he   says. “Those  are all clichés most retailers would claim as the hallmarks of   their  supply chain, but the depth, credibility and genuine nature of some of    those characteristics are significant. A large part of it is  non-negotiable.”
In it for   the long haul
McDonald’s   has had a presence in the UK since 1974, and has been  working with two   suppliers (McCain for potatoes and OSI for beef  patties) since “day one”. The   “vast majority” of its supply base in  the UK has been partnering with the   business for more than 20, maybe  even 30 years, McVeigh estimates. “Chopping   and changing,  flip-flopping between suppliers breeds a lack of confidence and   a  distrust which we can’t afford,” he adds.
This is   partly because the McDonald’s food requirements are  relatively small,   particularly when compared to a major supermarket.  McVeigh’s team only   sources 120 ingredients for the menu. “It’s not  wide, but the depth and scale   of our business in each of those [items]  is very important,” he says. With   more than 1,200 restaurants in the  UK serving more than 3.7m customers every   day, he’s not wrong. As with  the iceberg lettuce example, a shortage of any   one of the 120 items  would have a major impact on consumers. Consistency,   reliability and  quality are critical.
Long-term   relationships give suppliers confidence to grow and  invest in their own   businesses, creating a virtuous circle. McDonald’s  has a “three-legged stool”   operating model, with each leg of the  stool representing the business,   franchisees and suppliers. “Each of  those three partners plays an equal role   in contributing, but also an  equal level of being a beneficiary,” explains   McVeigh. It’s a model  that contributes to the business being consistently   ranked in  Gartner’s Supply Chain Top 25. It has been in second place every   year  since 2013. But however warm and fuzzy this all might sound, McVeigh    stresses that “partnership doesn’t mean we are soft on price”.
“We have   expectations, as do our customers – but every conversation  I have with a   supplier about price is usually followed by a  conversation about how we are   going to invest for the future. With a  stable and confident supply base, we   can focus on the stuff that  really excites me: how can we improve our   proposition and identify  those ‘big bets’ that we can get behind, together   with our suppliers?”
Now is the   time, he feels, to really zone in on those “big  bets”, given that McDonald’s has made considerable strides   over recent  years to improve the basics. “Ten years ago, we were struggling   with  [the basics] and giving our customers what they wanted from a quality,    provenance and sourcing perspective,” he acknowledges. That prompted a    “radical rethink” to put the customer at the heart of everything,  “even to   the detriment of the business financially in some instances”.
Consumer   demands around food have changed “enormously”, forcing  McDonald’s and other   fast-food retailers to up their game with healthy  options and quality.   McDonald’s’ US business in particular has  struggled in recent years due to   the perception that its food is  unhealthy and overprocessed, with sales   falling 3.3% over six years.  But a shift towards higher- quality food,   healthier choices and  in-store technology (many stores now allow customers to   order via  digital self-service kiosks) appears to have turned things around.    Last July, the company’s shares hit an all-time high.
The supply   chain-related questions people now ask about their food  have dramatically   shifted, says McVeigh. “Ten years ago, they would  have been talking about   speed of service, quality, cleanliness. Now,  they are asking about where the   food comes from, animal-welfare  standards and environmental standards. People   might be surprised that  customers at McDonald’s are asking those questions,   but we’ve listened  and acted accordingly.”
Environmental   focus
When it   comes to animal welfare, all pork and eggs are now  RSPCA-assured and   standards have been improved across chicken farms,  with all chickens having   access to natural daylight and pecking  objects – something McVeigh says is “a   first for a business of our  scale in the UK”. Many ideas for improvements   come from the supply  base: a meeting with a McDonald’s egg supplier in   Cumbria, for  example, has led to a mass tree planting initiative.
“Chickens   are hardwired to be concerned about overhead predators,”  explains McVeigh.   “[The supplier] had an idea about providing tree  cover on their free-range   egg farms. We supported them with some  scientific research, which found tree   cover improved the roaming  nature of the chickens, and ultimately improved   the yield and quality  of the eggs. We shared that with all our British   free-range egg  farmers, and six years later, we’ve planted 5,500 trees – an   area the  size of Hyde Park.”
The minimum   20% tree cover McDonald’s now insists on has informed  the standards of other   retailers, he claims. “That’s an incredibly  powerful and rewarding position   to be in: how we can join the dots  between what we do and what’s important to   our customers. The  decisions we make can positively influence so many people   and shape  expectations.”
On modern   slavery – a particular issue in agriculture – McDonald’s  trains its suppliers   on human rights via its Supplier Workplace  Accountability programme. Regular   unannounced audits include  inspections of housing and café facilities, and   workers are  interviewed privately.
Restaurant   sustainability is another area of focus. In October  2017, McDonald’s signed   an agreement, along with high-street brands  including Starbucks and Costa,   with the Alliance for Beverage Cartons  and the Environment to accelerate the   recycling of PE-lined paper  cups.
The company   has been working with two parties, including  papermakers James Cropper, to   overcome the technical challenges of  recycling plastic-coated cups. Now, all   McDonald’s cups can be  recycled into high-end stationery. “If you go to   Harvey Nichols or  Selfridges, that packaging could be made from a McDonald’s   cup,” says  McVeigh. The next challenge is to encourage more customers to   actually  bother to recycle their cups and provide more material, and   McVeigh’s  team have entered a partnership with two suppliers on “some  leading-edge   technology” to find a solution.
Buying   British is a major part of the company’s refreshed  proposition, one of the   “cornerstones” of what both customers and  suppliers are asking for, says   McVeigh. Despite McDonald’s being a  global corporate empire with a standard   operating model, he has the  flexibility to make changes such as this at   market level. Some 70% of  McVeigh’s £1bn supply chain spend goes to British   farmers and  suppliers – “and that’s growing”.
Supporting   British farming gives suppliers the confidence “to take a  punt” on investing   in their businesses. The company’s 2015 commitment  to buy 100% British   potatoes for its French fries is one example.  That has led to its supplier   McCain investing more than £100m in  refurbishing its UK production sites.   McVeigh adds: “Businesses like  that won’t make those decisions without some   degree of confidence in  their customer base.”
Communication   is key
The spectre   of Brexit looms large for the food industry. McVeigh  holds a fortnightly call   with some suppliers to discuss Brexit-related  matters – “to understand their   perspective, what they expect of us,  making sure we are close to the ground   in understanding concerns and  opportunities”. Over the last year, he has seen   a move to focusing on  what “we can control” and says Brexit concerns haven’t   stymied  investment or delayed decision-making.
“I’ve been   able to reassure our suppliers and farmers that… Brexit  may be uncertain and   may present potholes in the road, but it won’t  change our focus on what   matters to customers. And customers are still  telling me they want us to   support British farming.” The fortnightly  calls also make sure the business   can appropriately represent farmers’  concerns with industry bodies and   government.
Regular   communication with farmers is further enabled via the  company’s Farm Forward   programme. This agriculture strategy, launched  in 2012, supports British and   Irish farming and involves regular  surveys of the more than 17,500 farmers in   the supply chain. The most  recent survey found that a key challenge for the   agri-food industry is  the lack of people choosing it as a career. According   to the Food and  Drink Federation, more than 140,000 new entrants are needed   to  maintain food and drink production in the UK. “When you’ve got big    exposure and commitment to British food and farming, you have skin in  the   game,” says McVeigh.
In an effort   to help attract people into food-related jobs,  McDonald’s launched its Food   Steps campaign last year. It includes a  40ft virtual-reality-enabled truck   that allows people to “see the  supply chain end-to-end”. The truck has so far   engaged with about 1.5m  people. “We’re hoping we will have prompted them to   think differently  about food, farming and McDonald’s,” says McVeigh.
A bright   future
This   investment in virtual reality is not an isolated example of  cutting-edge   technology; there are plenty of others throughout the  McDonald’s supply   chain, showing an appetite from farmers to embrace  new tools. The company is   working with Leaf, its salad provider, on  using hydroponics for internal leaf   production, allowing delicate  salad leaves to be grown 52 weeks a year.
On a recent   potato farm visit, McVeigh met a farmer using drone  technology to look at his   22,000 acres of land. “He was using it to  assess the stone coverage, to be   able to decide what kind of crop to  put down and how to prepare the land for   that crop.” Another supplier,  a chicken farmer, has developed an app linked   up to CCTV, enabling  him to monitor his flock without being there 24/7 and   freeing up time  to develop his business elsewhere.
“Part of our   role is about understanding that technology and  feeding it back into our   [agriculture] strategy,” says McVeigh. “How  can we play a role in identifying   technological best practices, roll  it out and replicate it? That’s the fun   bit: where you can engage with  farmers who have got an appetite but may need   direction, finding out  what those best practice solutions are and bringing   farmers together  to share and discuss.”
Technology   is also being rolled out across distribution centres,  with a £25m investment   and a significant amount of automation  technology. By mid-2019, the UK will   have the most advanced and  automated McDonald’s distribution centres   globally. Given a case of  product is delivered to restaurants every two seconds   – that’s 71m  cases a year – any added efficiencies can make all the   difference to  busy front- and back-of-house employees. While temperature   checking  used to be done manually, it has been digitised, meaning a delivery    can now be received in seconds.
“We have   grown our business volume-wise by more than 50% over the  last five years and   have restaurants doing double the volume they were  built for,” says McVeigh.   “There’s a critical need for my team to  play their part so our crew can   provide the best experience for  customers, rather than spending time   receiving delivery. Where  automation can take away the burden and where our   supplier partners  can take on some accountability, freeing up staff in the   restaurants,  that’s a win for everyone.”
Looking to   the future, in a competitive, fast-changing market,  McVeigh is enthusiastic   about the impact strategic sourcing can have.  “It’s the opportunity to be   able to shape not just our supply chain,  but so much more of what will drive   our success: making our supply  chain more efficient, being bold, being able   to use our scale for  good.”
Customers,   he says, don’t want a different McDonald’s; they just  want a better one. “The   fundamentals they enjoy; they just want more  consistency and to turn up the   dial.” And, he hopes, a supply chain  strategy centred around ‘big bets’ will   play a major part in getting there.
