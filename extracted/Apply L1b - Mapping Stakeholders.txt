Mapping Stakeholders – Lesson 1 – Exercise 2
I believe the role of Head of Digital Education is one of the most influential stakeholders within Weston College. They are responsible for shaping the roadmap and success of the digital transformation agenda across the organisation. Positioned in the high power/high interest quadrant of Eden and Ackermann’s (1998) Power vs Interest grid, their ability to align Weston College priorities with external influences—from government bodies and exam boards to employers and Ofsted—is essential for delivering high-quality Teaching, Learning and Assessment.

The Head of Digital Education’s power lies in strategic leadership: influencing curriculum design, staff development, and working with IT Services to ensure the right digital infrastructure is in place. Their decisions directly impact my role as a Digital Coach, guiding how I support academic staff through mentoring, coaching, and leading projects that embed digital tools into teaching and learning. As Kenny (2014) notes, “stakeholders with disproportionate impact” can make or break an organisation’s plans—especially true in the complex landscape of digital education.

While their clarity of vision and strategic alignment bring many benefits, there are challenges in balancing the needs of other stakeholders—senior leaders, learners, awarding bodies, and external partners. As Bennis (2020) reminds us, “all claims deserve consideration but some claims are more important than others.” The Head of Digital Education must navigate these competing priorities, particularly under pressure from inspection bodies like Ofsted and the evolving digital skills agenda.

To support this, our relationship must be reciprocal (Freeman, 1984). I provide feedback on staff and learner needs, insights into the digital learning experience, and implementation challenges. In return, the Head of Digital Education uses this data to shape the strategic roadmap. It’s an organic and dynamic partnership that drives meaningful digital transformation across the College.
