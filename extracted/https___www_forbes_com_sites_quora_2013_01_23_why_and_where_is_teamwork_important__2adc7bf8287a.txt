Why And Where Is Teamwork Important?

Edmond Lau, Quora Engineer
Working effectively as part of a team is incredibly important for output quality, morale, and retention.
My professional experience involving teamwork has primarily been within software engineering, but most of the takeaway lessons aren't limited to engineering.
From the perspective of efficiency, a traditional argument against staffing large teams comes from Frederick Brooks's
The Mythical Man-Month
. A man-month or person-month refers to the unit of work that one person can accomplish in one month. The basic premise that Brooks argues against is the notion that a software project that takes one person a year to complete (twelve person-months) can have its timeline shortened to a single month simply by staffing the project with a dozen engineers. Upon seeing projects falling behind, many managers want to put schedules back on track by simply adding more engineers to the project.
The problem with this logic -- and the reason it's a myth -- is that each additional engineer added to a project incurs both communication and coordination overhead with everyone else on the team, and so the time to complete a project doesn't actually decrease linearly with increased staffing. This leads to what is commonly known as Brooks's
Law
, that "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." [1]
Because of this line of reasoning, managers or technical leads sometimes over-correct and attempt to maximize efficiency by staffing single-person projects to reduce the communication overhead down to zero. Some companies, like
Google
, even emphasize in their promotion processes that an engineer has to demonstrate ownership in a project, which incentivizes engineers to define and prioritize individual projects so that they can be the indisputable owners of those projects and increase their chances for a promotion.
The reality is that there are a number of downsides and risks to working alone that affect output quality and morale:
Working alone makes it harder to get early and continual design feedback, thereby decreasing output quality.
A tight feedback cycle is critical to achieving a productive state of flow [2], and the earlier that you can get feedback, the less likely that you'll waste time going down the wrong path and earlier you'll know to correct your course. In practice, one place where this shows up in software development is that it's significantly easier for someone to review your code and to give good feedback if they actually work on the same team as you and share the same project context as you; it's much harder to for someone on a different project to give you code. Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman capture this notion well in one of their taglines in
Team
Geek:
"software development is a team sport." [3]
Working alone reduces learning.
One part of this is related to the first point, where there are fewer people with a shared context to challenge your ideas. Another is that because the project takes much longer to complete, each individual working along works on fewer projects over time.
Working on a team increases the bus factor for a project.
The bus factor [4] of a project refers to the number of team members that can be hit by a bus (or gets sick, leaves the company, goes on maternity leave, etc.) before a project comes to a complete halt; a higher bus factor reduces risk on a project. It also helps prevent obscure and undocumented shortcuts taken by a single individual and forces team members to spread knowledge and to do things in a way that other people on the team can pick up if necessary.
Working on a team increases accountability.
Peer pressure is a powerful force. Particularly if you're working with people whom you respect and don't want to let down, the motivation to help your team succeed can override the dips in motivation that you encounter on days when you're not at your best.
Slower project momentum from working alone reduces morale.
Project estimation is hard, and projects tend to slip behind schedule. [5, 6] In single-person projects, a single stall can put the project to a halt, just like how in a grocery store with only one checkout line, one problematic customer or one item that needs a price check can put all sales to a temporary halt. With at least one additional person on the project, there can still at least be some forward momentum.A related point is that people tend to think about time spent on a project in terms of time elapsed and not time invested, so even if you've only been working part-time on a project for two months spread out over half a year, it's hard for you and others within the organization to internalize that and not think the entire project proceeded slowly and took half a year to complete. This disappointment at the time elapsed to a finish a project can also reduce overall morale and excitement.
The lows of a project are more demoralizing when working alone.
Sand traps that you struggle to get out of, monotonous work that you need to grind through, and bugs that seem to defy all understanding become less draining and more bearable when there's someone else to share the pain with.
The highs of a project are more motivating when working as a team.
Celebrating an achievement with teammates is a great way to boost morale. If you work alone, who are you going to high-five when you get something working?
The lower morale from solo projects also tends to mean lower employee happiness and consequently lower retention. For all these reasons, I strongly believe that one-person teams should be avoided in growing organizations and that the minimum team size should be two. In any project, there might be one-person tasks, but grouping those tasks thematically into a shared team context so that people are still working together toward a shared goal rather than working separately mitigates a lot of the above risks.
For companies with many ongoing projects or for products with large surface areas, it's tempting to argue that because there's so much to get done anyways, it makes sense to just staff a number of one-person teams (an oxymoron) on orthogonal projects to make some progress on everything. This can be a symptom that the organization is undisciplined enough to prioritize and either cut or serialize projects. In
Crossing the Chasm
, Geoffrey Moore argues that one reason many high-tech companies fail to take their product into the mainstream market is due to this lack of discipline in limiting the set of projects to focus on:  [7]
"This isn't rocket science, but it does represent a kind of discipline. And it is here that high-tech management shows itself most lacking. Most high-tech when it comes down to marketing choices, will continue to shy away from making niche commitments... [T]he claim is made that, although niche strategy is generally best, we do have time -- or we cannot afford -- to implement it now.  This is a ruse, of course, the true answer being much simpler: We do not have, nor are we willing to adopt, any discipline that would ever require us to stop pursuing any sale any time for any reason."
All of this doesn't mean that working on a team is easy. We've all probably had our share of project experiences where slackers who don't pull their own weight take the fun out of teamwork. But given the above risks, that doesn't mean we shouldn't figure out and practice how to build effective teams.
