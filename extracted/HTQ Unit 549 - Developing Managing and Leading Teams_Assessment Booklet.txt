Guideline word count
The written word, whether generated and/or recorded, is expected to form the majority of assessable work produced by Learners at Level 5. The amount and volume of written work for this unit should be broadly comparable to a word count of 5500 words within a margin of +/-10%. The unit also includes additional work in the form of work based evidence. Excessive use of word count is not grounds for referral, however, the CMI reserves the right to return work to the Centre for editing and resubmission by the Learner.  
The following are excluded from the written word count: Index or contents pages, headings and subheadings, diagrams, charts and graphs, bibliography.

Please see the CMI Assessment Guidance Policy for further guidance, along with the guidance on Command Verb Definitions.
