St holder theory is an idea about how
0:13
business really works it says that for
0:16
any business to be successful it has to
0:18
create value for customers suppliers
0:21
employees communities and financiers
0:24
shareholders Banks and others the people
0:26
with the money it says that you can't
0:29
look at any one of those Stakes or
0:31
stakeholders if you like in isolation
0:35
their interest has to go together and
0:37
the job of a manager or an entrepreneur
0:40
is to figure out how the interest of
0:42
customers suppliers communities
0:45
employees and financiers go in the same
0:49
direction now think about how important
0:54
each of these groups is for a business
0:56
to be successful think about a business
0:59
that's lost its edge with its customers
1:02
that has products and services that its
1:04
customers don't want as much or that
1:07
they don't want at all that's a business
1:08
in Decline think about a business who
1:12
manages suppliers in a way uh that the
1:15
suppliers don't make them better the
1:17
suppliers just take orders and sell
1:20
stuff but the suppliers aren't trying to
1:21
make a business more Innovative more
1:24
creative that's a business that's in a
1:26
holding pattern and probably in Decline
1:29
think about a business whose employees
1:31
don't want to be there every day who
1:33
aren't using 100% of their effort and
1:36
their energy and their creativity to
1:38
make the business better that's a
1:40
business in Decline think about a
1:42
business that's not a good citizen in
1:44
the community that routinely ignores or
1:48
violates local custom and law that
1:51
doesn't pay attention to the quality of
1:53
life in the community doesn't pay
1:55
attention to issues of corporate
1:57
responsibility of uh sustain ability of
2:00
its effects on civil society that's a
2:03
business that's soon to be regulated
2:05
into Decline and think about a business
2:07
that doesn't create value doesn't create
2:11
profits for its
2:12
financiers it shareholders Banks and
2:15
others that's a business in Decline so
2:18
stakeholder theory is the idea that each
2:21
one of these groups is important to the
2:23
success of a business and figuring out
2:26
where their interests go in the same
2:27
direction is what the man managerial
2:30
task and the entrepreneurial task is all
2:32
about stakeholder Theory says if you
2:35
just focus on financiers you miss what
2:40
makes capitalism tick what makes
2:43
capitalism tick is that shareholders and
2:46
financiers customers suppliers employees
2:51
communities can together create
2:53
something that no one of them can create
2:56
alone
